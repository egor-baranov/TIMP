# TIMP

Now project is being at the **very early** prototype stage.

In fact, it is a parallel version of the music player [that I started a year ago](https://github.com/egor-baranov/FlacPlayer).
My decision to switch to flutter with a native android development is multi-platform and more simple and convenient code writing, but this does not mean that I will abandon the previous project.

First, as last time, I plan to make a working model of the player, after which I will add functions of telegram client using [flutter TDLib package](https://pub.dev/packages/tdlib).
