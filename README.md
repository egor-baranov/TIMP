# TIMP

Now project is being at the prototype stage.

In fact, it is a parallel version of the music player [&lt;that I started a year ago&gt;](https://github.com/egor-baranov/FlacPlayer).
My decision to switch to flutter with a native android development is multi-platform and more simple and convenient code writing, but this does not mean that I will abandon the previous project.
